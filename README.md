# GK's ARcade

A collection of different AR games.

1. Energy Ball. A sentient energy ball is traveling through spacetime, but got stuck! In order for it to have enough energy to travel home, you reflect its energy projectiles back at it with a little more speed. 
2. Out of Sight, Out of Mind. Time only passes where you're looking - so try to get all the clock alarms to go off at once!
3. some version of red light green light but virtual.
4. somehow you try to break the tracking??
5. some collaborative game where people see DIFFERENT items (perhaps turn-based / vocal)
